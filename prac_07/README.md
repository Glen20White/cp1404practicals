# Practical 07

## About This Repo
This repository contains my practical work for **CP1404: Programming II**.  
It includes code from each weekly prac folder, along with examples of object-oriented programming, file handling, data structures, and clean coding practices.

### About Me
My name is Glen White and I am currently studying Electrical Engineering at James Cook University.  
This repo shows my progress as I learn to write cleaner, more maintainable Python code.

## Key Lessons Learned About Clean Code
- Use functions and classes to separate responsibilities
- Meaningful naming matters
- Keep code consistent and readable

# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracies were pretty close, but they usually took longer than I expected.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

My estimate accuracy improved over the course as I got better at predicting how long they would take, 
I also increase my estimates to give more time in researching

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned to set a goal for myself to strive to stay focused and work steadily toward completing each task.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned to add clarity to my code so that other people could understand it easier

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learned to spot improvements that helped me spot improvements in my own code

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[LucasDummett Prac 06 code review](https://github.com/LucasDummett/cp1404practicals/pull/2)

### Explanation

I highlighted several strengths in his work with positive comments, pointed out a line of code that he may have 
forgotten to remove, identified a small typo, and provided helpful suggestions for adding error validation.

### Good Code Review 2

[lexieg77 Prac 07 code review](https://github.com/LucasDummett/cp1404practicals/pull/2#pullrequestreview-3439415756)

### Explanation

I recommended formatting the cost value to two decimal places, corrected one of the programming language entries in the 
class, suggested ways to make longer lines of code easier to read, recommended improvements for readability on longer 
lines of code, and pointed out an unfilled docstring that needed completion.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I personally wouldn't change anything about the practicals. They provided plenty of guidance and were structured well, 
starting with easier walkthrough examples and gradually increasing in difficulty. This made it easier to build 
confidence while applying concepts from the lectures. The practicals also offered solutions when needed, which was 
really helpful if you got stuck or wanted to check your understanding.


### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

For the practicals, I did well at reading and understanding what was required for the task and working through them
methodically. I was able to apply what I learned from the lectures to create successful code.
I also did well at debugging issues when they appeared.
